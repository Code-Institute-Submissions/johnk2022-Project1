Welcome to my very first website!

This website was built as part of the learning material for Code Institute's Fullstack Web Developer program.

A lot of experimentation, trial, and at times, mostly error.  

For this reason, most of the work was completed offline using Virtual Studio and Notepad++.

A little concerned that I would flood GitHub with thousands of commits and restores.

Uploaded to GitHub at key points.

You can check out the website [here](https://johnk2022.github.io/Project1/)!

## Project Description

This site was created in order to get familiar with common development tools like Git & GitHub, and how to use them to write and manage code.

Coco the dog.  Puppy, Princess, Primadonna, and all-round nuisance.

### Audience

Initally, family and friends.  Requiired: Who is Coco.  Gallery.  Blog.  Meet up.

Expanding to provide dog walking and grooming services to the general public.
